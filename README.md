## Image Processing Tool
---
Today, image editing has begun to show itself in more areas of our lives, especially with the rapid development of digital technologies. With the rapid development of mobile phones or cameras, people started to take more images. The photos obtained may not always be of the desired quality. Problems such as the presence of unnecessary details in the photograph, the inability to obtain the desired color, the presence of defects in the photograph, blur, excessive brightness may be encountered. Our project consists of three parts: basic operations on the images, automatic image enhancement and artistic effect and filters.
